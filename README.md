<h1 align="center">C Algorithms</h1>
<h2 align="center">Information</h1>

This is a personal project that is being updated alongside my data structures classes where I take the barebones algorithms for each structure, implement them in C, and then attempt to improve them through various means.

This project's code is explained to a very good extend to allow for easy understanding from users of all levels.

> [!NOTE]
> In the "releases" section, you will soon be able to find this repository turned into a C library, to allow for integration whithin your programs.
